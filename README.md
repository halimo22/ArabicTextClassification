# Arabic Text Classification

This project focuses on classifying Arabic text using machine learning techniques. The aim is to develop an efficient model that can categorize text into predefined classes.

## Overview

Arabic text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP). This project implements various classification algorithms to effectively categorize Arabic text data. It explores different approaches, evaluates their performance, and identifies the most suitable method for this task.

## Features

- Text preprocessing techniques for Arabic language.
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.).
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- Visualization of results for better understanding.
